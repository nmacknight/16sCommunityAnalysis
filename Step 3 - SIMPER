###SIMPER analysis
library(vegan)
coral.sim=simper(D[,6:7230],D$Infected) #6:7230 are your reads for your bacteria OTUs/ASVs, and I want to compare a column "Infected" which were different disease states (control, disease-exposed, disease-infected).
summary(coral.sim)

#If the simper is too large to view at once: I found this by going to the environment on the right and clicking "coral.sim" and then the magnfying glass near that
coral.sim[["Control_Disease Band"]]
#or
coral.sim[["Exposed astereoides_Exposed cavernosa"]][["overall"]] ##This little golden nugget is the overall dissimilarity between the comparison being made. It is a metric that can be used to later determine magnitude of change or imbalance (microbial dysbiosis) is occuring.


#Send this simper data to an excel file 

results.test.coral.sim <- summary(coral.sim)
df <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, results.test.coral.sim)

##SIMPER analysis comparing species bacteria community between treatments. The previous simper compared treatments.
