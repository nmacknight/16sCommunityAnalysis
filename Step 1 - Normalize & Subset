#identify minimum reads from a sample, we will normalize proportionally to this read value. In this example it was 3382. 16s on a Miseq should average to 20k reads/sample.
## this takes a subsample of reads from each OTU; from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18385099/random-subsampling-in-r
# create function:
## Initially takes in a row of the data and the number of samples to take
sample_species <- function(counts,n) {
  num_species <- length(counts)
  total_count <- sum(counts)
  samples <- sample(1:total_count,n,replace=FALSE)
  samples <- samples[order(samples)]
  result <- array(0,num_species)
  total <- 0
  for (i in 1:num_species) {
    result[i] <- length(which(samples > total & samples <= total+counts[i]))
    total <- total+counts[i]
  }
  return(result)
}

#"OTU.counts" is the original count data from the sequencer. "C" is the normalized and subsetted data. 
library(readr)
OTU.counts <- read.csv("OTU.counts.reannotation.csv")
A <- t(OTU.counts)
write.csv(A, file = "A.reannotation.csv") #Add treatment and type (coral sample or water sample)
B <- read.csv("A.reannotation.csv")
C <- apply(B[,6:7230],1,sample_species,3382)## This applies the above function to the minimum read count of 3382 in our dataset and provides normalized read count results.
write.csv(C, file = "C.reannotaion.csv")
D <- t(C) #Had trouble getting this to work but let tab-complete for the function and file fill in the gaps. 
write.csv(D, file = "D.reannotation.csv") #subsample now completed. Just needs to open the C.csv and add OTU names and sample names.
